= RoSS - RSS fetcher =

- There will be a file with URL to atom/rss feed on each line
- Get the xml from each of them and keep in memory
- For each xml, parse it and get items from last week / since last synchronization
- It could be run from cron, or keep it's own timekeeping.  Probably better from cron.
- On each run, a plaintext email should be formed with dates, links and titles to all new items.
  This could be done by another small program, I think.
- Is there anything that needs to be retained?
  - date of last synchronization - maybe
- What is the input?  What is the output?
  - Input: list of feed URLs
  - Output: list of date|title|link of articles published during the last week (it could be csv or
    tsv)
